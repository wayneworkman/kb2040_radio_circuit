## 1) POWER / BARREL PLUG CONNECTIONS (HIGH-SIDE MOSFET SWITCH)

1. **Power Supply**  
   - Provides **12 V DC** via a **female** barrel connector.  
   - Red wire = +12 V, Black wire = Ground (GND).  

2. **Radio**  
   - Expects **12 V DC** via a **male** barrel plug.  
   - Red wire = +12 V input, Black wire = GND.  

3. **P-Channel MOSFET (e.g. FQP27P06)**  
   - **Source (S)** → +12 V from the supply’s red wire.  
   - **Drain (D)** → Red wire to the radio’s +12 V input.  
   - **Gate (G)** → Pulled up to +12 V through a 10 kΩ resistor and driven low (toward GND) to switch the radio power on.  (Often driven by an NPN transistor from the KB2040 or a dedicated driver circuit.)  
   - The **black (GND) wires** from supply to radio pass straight through and also connect to the KB2040 ground.  

This forms a **high-side power switch** controlled by the KB2040, allowing you to turn the radio’s +12 V on/off.

## 2) PTT CIRCUIT (2N2222 or PN2222)

1. **KB2040 pin D9** → one end of a **4.7 kΩ** resistor.  
2. Other end of that 4.7 kΩ resistor → **Base** pin of the 2N2222 transistor.  
3. A **1 nF capacitor** and **470 kΩ resistor** in parallel from **Base** to **Emitter** (for RF filtering and a weak pull-down).  
4. **Collector** → Black wire (radio’s Mic– / PTT line).  
5. **Emitter** → KB2040 ground (common GND with radio).  

When **D9** is driven high (~3.3 V), the transistor conducts and pulls the radio’s PTT line to ground, activating transmit.

## 3) AUDIO OUTPUT TO RADIO MIC INPUT

1. **KB2040 pin A0** → one end of a **10 kΩ** resistor.  
2. Other end of that 10 kΩ resistor → one end of a **10 nF** capacitor.  
3. Other end of that 10 nF capacitor → Radio mic input (red wire).  
4. Radio mic– (black wire) → 2N2222 collector from the PTT circuit (goes to ground when transmitting).  

The 10 kΩ + 10 nF serve as a low-pass / coupling filter for your PWM-based FSK audio.

## 4) AUDIO PRESENCE DETECTION (ENVELOPE DETECTOR)

**Goal**: Sense if the Baofeng’s speaker output has audio (i.e., channel is busy) before transmitting.  

1. **Radio Speaker Output**  
   - Tap into the Baofeng’s speaker or headphone jack (e.g., the top 3.5 mm jack if using a Kenwood K-plug).  
   - This signal can be **loud**, so set the radio volume to a consistent level.  

2. **AC-Coupling Capacitor** (0.1 µF to 1 µF, e.g., **Kemet C1206C104K5RACTU**)
   - One side → Baofeng speaker output.  
   - Other side → **Anode** of the diode (next step).  

3. **Diode** (small-signal or Schottky, e.g., **1N4148** or **BAT54**)  
   - **Anode** from the AC-coupling capacitor.  
   - **Cathode** goes to a node we’ll call “Envelope Node.”  

4. **Envelope Node**  
   - At the diode cathode, place a **capacitor** (0.01 µF to 1 µF, e.g., **Kemet C0805C104K5RACTU**) to ground in parallel with a **resistor** (10 kΩ to 1 MΩ) to ground.  
   - The same node → **KB2040 ADC pin** (e.g. A1).  

```

   [AC Coupling C]
         |
 (Diode Anode)   Diode (Cathode)  --->-- Envelope Node ---> KB2040 A1
                                 |
                            [Cap to GND]
                                 |
                            [Res to GND]
                                 |
                                GND
```

**Operation**  
- Audio passes through the capacitor (blocking DC). On positive audio peaks, the diode conducts, charging the envelope capacitor.  
- The resistor sets how quickly the capacitor discharges (sets the decay time).  
- The KB2040 ADC reads this “peak voltage.” If it’s above a certain threshold, the channel is likely busy.

## 5) COMMON GROUND & NOTES

- Tie the **KB2040 GND**, **radio barrel connector black wire**, and all other negative leads together, unless you are specifically implementing full isolation.  
- Keep leads short and add ferrite beads / shielded cable if needed for RFI suppression.  
- Ensure the envelope node stays below 3.3 V (if your radio speaker output can exceed this, use an extra resistor divider before the AC coupling or reduce the volume).

### Typical Parts

- **Transistors**: 2N2222 (PTT), MOSFET FQP27P06 (power)  
- **Diode** (envelope): 1N4148 or BAT54  
- **Coupling/Filter Capacitors**: 10 nF (mic), 0.1 µF to 1 µF (envelope)  
- **Resistors**: 4.7 kΩ (PTT base), 10 kΩ–1 MΩ (envelope discharge), 10 kΩ (mic).  
- **Supply**: 12 V DC input via barrel connector.

With these connections, the KB2040 can **power** the radio, **key PTT** to transmit audio, and **measure** the envelope of the radio’s speaker output to decide if the channel is clear.
